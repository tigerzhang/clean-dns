# Tasks

- [ ] Explore codebase to identify hook points for statistics <!-- id: 0 -->
- [ ] Create implementation plan <!-- id: 1 -->
- [ ] Implement data structure for statistics <!-- id: 2 -->
- [ ] Implement statistics gathering logic <!-- id: 3 -->
    - [ ] Domain names <!-- id: 4 -->
    - [ ] IP addresses resolved <!-- id: 5 -->
    - [ ] Resolve request count <!-- id: 6 -->
    - [ ] Cache hit count <!-- id: 7 -->
    - [ ] Latest resolve timestamp <!-- id: 8 -->
- [ ] Add API/Interface to view statistics (if needed, or just log them?) - User didn't specify, but usually "add statistics support" implies some way to access them. I will assume a basic dump or API is needed. For now, I'll focus on the core logic and maybe add a simple debug/monitoring endpoint or log output.
- [ ] Verify implementation <!-- id: 9 -->
